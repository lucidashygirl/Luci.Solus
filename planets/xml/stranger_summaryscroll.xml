        <Text>HYACINTH: Well, I ran out of recorders, so I have to imbue the rest of my information on a scroll.</Text>

        <Text>HYACINTH: So, I found a fire that isn't surrounded by others, and I slept with the device in my hand. I woke up with it lit in my hand and without my suit! (Hopefully I can prevent the latter in the future.)</Text>

    <TextBlock>

        <ParentID>1</ParentID>
        <Text>HYACINTH: I can't tell if this would be seen as a grand discovery or sacrelige, best to keep this knowledge to myself for now.</Text>

    <TextBlock>
        <ID>7</ID>
